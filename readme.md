## TRB Annual Meeting Posters

`tex` files of my posters in `TRB annual meeting` are complied here. The source files are replicable. Like to note here:
* Previously I have used `TexWorks` for mac os. There's issue of retina display 1x blurriness. [Retinizer](http://retinizer.mikelpr.com) is a small tool to make 1X files make retina display ready.
* Recently I have been using `Sublime Text 3` and `TextMate 2`. In `Sublime Text 3` we need to go through several steps to make it ready for rendering pdf. But `TextMate 2` is just ready to go.
