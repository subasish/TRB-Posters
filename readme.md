## TRB Annual Meeting Posters

`tex` files of my posters in `TRB annual meeting` are complied here. The source files are replicable. Like to note here:
* Previously I have used `TexWorks`. There's issue of retina display 1x burness. [Retinizer](http://retinizer.mikelpr.com) is a small tool to make 1X files make retina display ready.
* Recently I am using `Sublime Text 3` and `TextMate 2`. In Sublime Text 3 we need to go through several steps to make it ready for rendering pdf. But TextMate is just ready to go.
